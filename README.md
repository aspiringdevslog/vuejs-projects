# First App
I want to create some sort of data table with filters and things like that.

Components would probably include:
- Data table
- Uploading data (as JSON)
- Adding comments to different data rows
- Filter panel


# Design Decision
Database: Firebase/Firestore, because it's free and seems easy to implement
UI Components: Vuetify, there seems to be many pre-made templates to use

# Dependencies
Make sure to install in firstapp folder rather than the root folder

- vue-router
- vuetify
- firebase
- vue-resource
- vue-firestore
- vuefire
